#### Project Overview

SKIMLIT is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) project focused on aiding the comprehension and summarization of scientific papers. The primary aim of SKIMLIT is to classify different parts of academic publications' abstracts into specific categories. This can be particularly useful for researchers, students, or anyone interested in quickly understanding the key components of a scientific paper without having to read the entire document.

The core functionality of SKIMLIT revolves around the dissection of abstracts into distinct sections such as:

1) Objective or Background: This section identifies the main goals or the background of the study.
2) Methods: This part describes the methodology used in the research.
3) Results: Here, the key findings of the study are presented.
4) Conclusions: This section outlines the implications of the findings, including their relevance and potential impact.

By using NLP techniques, SKIMLIT automates the process of segmenting these abstracts. The project likely utilizes various NLP tools and algorithms, such as named entity recognition, text classification, and possibly deep learning models like Transformers, to accurately categorize each part of the abstract.
This automated classification not only speeds up the process of literature review but also helps in better organizing the information for quick reference and analysis. For instance, a researcher looking for specific methodological approaches in a vast array of papers can quickly locate the relevant section in each abstract, saving time and effort.
